# Abstract
Diversity is one of the core values of modern society, with far-reaching philosophical, political, and economic implications. While prior academic research offers mixed evidence on the link between diversity and future firm value, many studies suffer from limited scope and outdated data. This research addresses these gaps through a comprehensive empirical analysis of more than 8,000 publicly listed companies across over 40 countries, spanning approximately two decades through Q1/2025. Leveraging 14 distinct diversity indicators and 19 performance metrics, the findings reveal a complex and dynamic relationship: in many cases, greater diversity is associated with improved future firm performance, which in turn fosters greater investment in diversityâ€”--suggesting a circular, bidirectional effect. The evidence also points out potential nonlinear patterns, with some forms of diversity exhibiting convex or concave relationships with firm performance. These results highlight the importance of setting realistic expectations: while diversity is not a guaranteed driver of financial returns, it is also not detrimental. Diversity may confer broader societal benefits, such as enhanced trust, innovation, and social cohesion. Policy efforts are likely to be more effective when focused on promoting diversity through economic incentives, rather than relying solely on regulatory mandates, which may entail unintended social and administrative costs.
